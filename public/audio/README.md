# Audio Files

This directory should contain audio files for the MoodBoost application.

## Supported formats:

- WAV
- MP3
- OGG

## Default tracks (optional):

- rain.wav - Gentle rain sounds
- ocean.wav - Ocean wave sounds
- forest.wav - Forest ambient sounds
- meditation.wav - Meditation bell sounds
- piano.wav - Peaceful piano music

The application now generates its own audio using Web Audio API, so these files are optional.
Users can also upload their own custom audio files through the audio controls interface.
